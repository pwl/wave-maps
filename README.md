Blow-up for corotational wave maps
===

This repository contains the code used to generate numerical solutions
to a corotationally symmetric wave-map equation.  The equation is
solved using a moving mesh method.

For the detailed usage example refer to `test/wave-maps.jl`.  You can
load it by running `julia` in the main directory of this repository
and executing

```
include("test/wave-maps.jl")
```
